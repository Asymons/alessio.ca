I'm Alessio, a software engineer since 2015. Remote work isn't just part of my career, it's core to how I operate, and I plan to stick with it for the long haul.

Since 2020, remote work has exploded. Some companies pulled back, others doubled down, but the truth is this isn't just a trend. Remote is here to stay, and for many of us, it can carry an entire career.

## **Why I Chose Remote**

Remote gives me control. I don't waste hours commuting, I don't need to cram into dense, expensive spaces just to be near an office, and I can build healthier habits at home. I'm more comfortable, more focused, and far less distracted than in an open office full of idle chatter and shoulder taps.

Flexibility is a double-edged sword, though. Remote can blur work and life if you let it. The trick is setting boundaries: log off, keep separate devices, and turn things off when it's 5 p.m. If your company expects 24/7, this is unreasonable and leads to burnout (barring occasional emergencies). Ultimately, a decent company should recognize impact over presence and respect the boundaries you set.

## **What I Miss About the Office**

Of course, remote has trade-offs:

* **In-person connection**: you build relationships faster in person, but ultimately what matters is impact, not how often you compliment your boss' hackathon shirt.
* **Quick answers**: yes, tapping someone on the shoulder is faster. Most of the time, what I need answered isn't urgent or technical. A slack message can be sufficient or a quick huddle.
* **Free food**: not joking, earlier in my career I've stayed later for this perk & I hear people admit the lunch & snacks are the only reason they show up.

Discipline is also harder. You need to manage your own structure, set goals, and hold yourself accountable. Personally, I use calendar reminders and keep career goals front of mind. I've also had great mentorship remotely, so I don't buy the idea that it's impossible to grow without being in-office.

## **Why I Stayed in Canada**

Like many Canadian devs, I considered moving to the U.S. The pay can be much higher, and for some it makes sense. But for me, staying in Canada works better and was highly influenced by my fiancee.

Once your basic needs are met (housing, savings, comfort), chasing "money go up" stops being meaningful unless you're obsessed with retiring early. I'd rather build cool things and live a balanced life.

From a career perspective, Canada is a pretty sweet deal:

* **Employers love Canadian devs**: we're highly educated, cheaper than U.S. hires, and we speak English natively.
* **Time zones**: EST overlaps nicely with both PST and EU, which is a huge advantage for async work.
* **Stability**: if you're a citizen like myself, no visas to worry about and the nation is highly regarded globally

Yes, the U.S. pays more, but there are plenty of decent remote opportunities so I don't feel like I'm missing out.

## **Final Thoughts**

Remote work gives me the freedom to work comfortably, focus deeply, and skip the nonsense that doesn't matter. Living in Canada lets me pair that freedom with stability, relationships, and a solid quality of life.

If you're a Canadian dev thinking about moving south, ask yourself: is it really about the money, or about what that money enables? A bigger number in your bank account won't make you happy (unless you're Mr. Wonderful) but the right balance of work, freedom, and lifestyle might.

In the long run, I think companies will always want cheaper labor with high-quality output. Canada is perfectly positioned to be the "value pick": educated workforce, same time zone, shared culture, native English, and yes, we are friendly.
